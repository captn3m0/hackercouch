This is my home, an apartment with space for more than just me. Anybody is welcome for a week and tips on community spaces and gatherings are free and plentiful. If you're lucky or plan ahead, there might even be small gatherings at my place. Personally my interests revolve around security, new media, digital sculpture and user interfaces. Im happy to collaborate and facilitate skill sharing, but a simple crashpad is also offered,

This couch is an inclusive and safe space free of any sort of disctimination.
