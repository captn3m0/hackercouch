We have an apartment in central Athens with a couch-bed for anyone wishing to
stay. We are fellows of the hackerspace.gr and we love kickstarting projects ex
nihilo. There are loads of books on CS, philosophy and poetry in the house and
spoken languages extend to native English, Spanish, Greek (obviously), French,
Romanian, some Russian and some Chinese (Mandarin).

Internet is not included, but we can share the ones we use (craftmanship is a
pro), feel free to bring your own high-gain antenna.

Tour around Athens included and (if you feel like it) we could help co-organize a presentation
at the hsgr to educate others.
