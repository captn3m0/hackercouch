I have internet and you can just show up whenever you want and knock (tell my roomates you met me on some Hackathon - **don't** just say you are a stranger!)
[Here](https://forvo.com/word/chagai) is how you pronounce my name.
[Here](https://tiny.cc/chagai) is how you can contact me easily.
I can give you Swiss Franks if you are visiting Switzerland and you can just pay me back however you want, that way you don't have to pay for the money exchange.
