I am a pirate (as in Pirate Party) / hacker from Belgium, who moved to sunny Cape Town. 
Living in an apartment in Brooklyn (Milnerton) with an awesome artist as house mate. We have a spacious living room with a few couches, contact me to check if one is available to crash on. We have WiFi, thouch not uncapped at the moment unfortunately, working on that.
