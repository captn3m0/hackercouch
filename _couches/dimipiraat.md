I am a pirate, princess, sailboat captain from Belgium, living in sunny Cape Town when I'm not traveling.

Living in the deep south (Southern Peninsula) just outside Simon's Town with my wife, our little dog and a few cats.

We have WiFi and a generator, but loadshedding still affects us, trying to fix that. Solarpunk FTW!
