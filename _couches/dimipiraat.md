I am a pirate (as in Pirate Party) from Belgium, who moved to sunny Cape Town.
Living in an apartment in Brooklyn (Milnerton) with an awesome artist as house mate. We have a spacious living room with a few couches, contact me to check if one is available to crash on. 
We have WiFi, not uncapped at the moment unfortunately, working on that.
