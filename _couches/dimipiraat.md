I am a pirate (as in Pirate Party) from Belgium, who moved to sunny Cape Town.
Living in a house in the deep South (Simon's Town) with my wife, a dog and some cats. We have a spare room with a futon as well as a pretty compy couch in the living room, contact me to check if we are home (as in not traveling as that happens regularly) and have a couch available.
We have WiFi, although it is not always 100% reliable.
