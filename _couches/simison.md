### Modern nomad, an activist and a friend.

I've spent a lot of my time on the road â€” itâ€™s in my nature. Often I've hitchhiked, cycled or hiked a mountain.

I'm a thinker, maker & activist. I like making stuff, be it from wood, electronics or code.

I'm a techie working at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). As a hobby, I build open source & non-profit [travel projects](http://www.mikaelkorpela.fi/volunteering/) (I co-founded [Trustroots](https://www.trustroots.org/team) and I'm also behind [Hitchwiki](http://hitchwiki.org/), [Nomadwiki](http://nomadwiki.org/) and [Trashwiki](http://trashwiki.org/)).

I enjoy a company of positive and talkative people.
Donâ€™t be evil. Be yourself.

I have a good tolerance for different people and behaviour.
You can be odd if you want to.

I live with [Simona](https://photos.wanderlust.lt/) and our two kiddos.

We're often out of Vilnius and we don't plan much ahead; I don't usually know what are my plans many weeks ahead. Last minute messages are great!

We're often heading out to the countryside on the weekends.

I love cycling, sauna, inspiring music and I have high respect for good, fresh food.
