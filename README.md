# Hackercouch

HackerCouch is couchsurfing for Hackers. Here's how it goes:

- Fork this repo
- Add your own markdown file with your nick (perhaps twitter/github handle?) in the `_couches` directory
- You file a Pull Request on [github][gh]
- Make sure the build passes
- Go check hackercouch.com the next time you are travelling.

See [add.md](add.md) for more detailed instructions.

The idea isn't new, it has been [tried before][original] as well. The reason I'm trying this again is:

- I love the idea of a Fork->PR->Merge->Publish flow with almost zero effort.
- hackercouch.com was available.

I also made a similar PR-based DNS redirect service called [lightsaber][ls] recently.

# Development

- HackerCouch uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) Collections, which is a feature I really like.
- Hosted on Github pages, duh.
- Builds use Travis, and make sure that the site has proper html before its deployed.

### Quickstart:
```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
jekyll serve
```

And open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

### Troubleshooting
- If your bundle fails due Nokogiri and you're on OSX, try running this first: `xcode-select --install`
