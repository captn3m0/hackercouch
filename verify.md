We (optionally) allow you to verify your social profiles.
We ask you to publish a hash on your public profile on
the social network.

We fetch the profile and verify the hash at our end.

Not all platforms allow us to verify your profile, and we
implement it for the following:

### Twitter

1. Post a new tweet with the hash as per your profile page
2. Add a new key: `verify.twitter` in your couch file, with the tweet id as its value

### Website

1. Create a file called `hackercouch.txt` with the hash.
2. Upload it to your website so it is accessible at `/.well-known/hackercouch.txt`
3. You can add more content to the file, if you wish.

### GitHub

1. Create a new public gist
2. In a file called hackercouch.txt in the gist, paste your hash
3. Add a new key: `verify.github` in your couch file, with the gist id as the value
4. Ensure that the gist is public

### Reddit

1. Create a new post in r/hackercouch_verify
2. Post your hash in the post
3. Add a new key: `verify.reddit` in your couch file, with the post id as the value

### Notes

Once your post is published and verified, do not delete it.


### Technical Details

The hash is generated by the following string:

    "#{nick}.hackercouch/#{platform}/#{platform_nick}"

Where:

- nick is your hackercouch nick
- platform is twitter|github|reddit|website
- platform_nick is the value of the nick as per your couch file

This is handy in case you want to generate the hash offline or
want to verify yourself in your first PR.
